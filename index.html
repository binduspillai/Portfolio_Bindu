        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My professional journey began in 1999 as an educator, where I spent 7 years teaching Mathematics and Computer Science in various schools, engineering colleges, and polytechnics in Mumbai. This foundational experience in education developed my ability to explain complex concepts clearly and mentor others.

In 2008, I transitioned into technology, bringing my analytical mindset and teaching skills into the data engineering field. Today, as a Principal Clinical Insight Analyst at Cytel Inc., I lead the development and validation of datasets for clinical trials, analyzing large datasets to uncover trends and insights that drive data-driven decision making.

Throughout my career, I've successfully bridged the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders, providing end-to-end engineering solutions using various Data Engineering tools. My expertise spans across Databricks, Python, DBT, and Snowflakes, with deep experience in Retail, Banking & Insurance, and Life Science domains.

My unique combination of educational background and technical expertiseenables me to not only deliver complex data solutions but also effectively mentor teams and communicate insights across all organizational levels.
